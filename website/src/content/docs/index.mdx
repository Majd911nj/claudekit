## Why Claude Kit?

### The Problem

Working with Claude Code is powerful, but raw Claude has limitations:

- **Context Spirals** — Token budgets run out, context gets lost mid-task
- **Inconsistent Output** — Quality varies between sessions
- **Manual Workflows** — Same prompts copied between projects
- **No Structure** — Every session starts from scratch

### The Solution

Claude Kit provides the structure, patterns, and automation that makes Claude Code production-ready:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Structured Workflows" icon="rocket">
    Commands like `/feature` orchestrate multi-phase development: planning → implementation → testing → review → ship.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Context Control" icon="document">
    Modes and skills give Claude the exact context it needs. No more explaining your stack every session.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consistent Quality" icon="approve-check">
    Built-in code review, testing standards, and security checks ensure every output meets your standards.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fully Customizable" icon="pencil">
    Add your own commands, modes, and skills. Claude Kit is a template, not a black box.
  </Card>
